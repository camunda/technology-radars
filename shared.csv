OKRs,Techniques,Adopt,FALSE,"OKRs stands for Objectives and Key Results. At the beginning of every quarter we plan which objectives we want to accomplish. Each objective is broken down into key results. Our team OKRs are in line with the company OKRs. Every week we update our OKR sheet with a value between 0 and 10 for each key result, to express how likely we find it to complete that key result. That way we can always judge our current progress."
DRIs,Techniques,Adopt,FALSE,"DRI stands for Directly-Responsible Individual. A DRI is responsible for ensuring that the team reaches a goal. Each team member can be the DRI for an area of expertise or one of our quarterly objectives. Based on input from others, DRI's take informed decisions. Consent is not strictly required. We disagree and commit, if necessary."
1:1,Techniques,Adopt,FALSE,"Our developers have weekly 1:1 meetings with the Engineering Manager that provide each of us up to an hour of time to improve continuously and to give each other feedback. We also do skip-level 1:1's that skip one level of the hierarchy at a slower schedule."
Infrastructure as Code,Techniques,Adopt,FALSE,"We use kustomize, docker-compose, GitHub Actions and to some extent terraform to automate and document the recurring parts of our deployments."
CI/CD,Techniques,Adopt,FALSE,"We have about a dozen parallel jobs that run for each push to a pull request and check our codebase and run all unit, integration and e2e tests. We have few manual tests - only for third-party service that actively work against automatic testing of their APIs. In order to merge code into the master branch, all checks have to pass. After code is merged into master, automated jobs run to deploy our application."
DevOps,Techniques,Adopt,FALSE,"The developers of our team also operate and monitor our SaaS services. Each week a developer acts as a medic. The SRE and Infra teams support us in more advanced scenarios."
Code of Conduct,Techniques,Adopt,FALSE,"A set of rules we defined as a team to create a pleasant and sustainable working environment"
No estimates,Techniques,Adopt,FALSE,"We do no estimate how much time we are going to need to finish a task or achieve a goal. We prioritize and maintain a steady flow of ""small"" pieces of work. We thereby ensure that the most important stuff gets done first and that we are able to adjust our plans."
Pair programming,Techniques,Adopt,FALSE,"We do pair programming on demand to share knowledge or refactor code."
Chapter,Techniques,Trial,FALSE,"Chapters at Camunda invite to monthly meetings with employees that work and/or are interested in a certain field. Frontend Engineers do e.g. join the Frontend Chapter. During these meetings, Camundos can share their work experience, ask questions or start a discussion - across teams"
